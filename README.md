# coders

This the code repository for the Coding Community of Practice ("coders"), 
founded in 2019 by the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health 
Sciences (DEOHS) at the University of Washington (UW) School of Public 
Health (SPH).

This community fosters a culture of coding excellence by encouraging coders 
to improve their skills and the quality of their code. We meet regularly to 
provide coding demonstrations, engage in workshops, and participate in code 
review. We also share our experience and knowledge through a mentoring program 
for UW students.

This repository contains some demonstrations (listed below). Additional 
resources may be found in the [wiki](wiki).

## R onramp

To help you get a head start, we created an "onramp" series designed to teach 
you the basics, from navigating the RStudio interface to creating figures. 
We cover R language basics, data wrangling, creating scripts and more!

# Demos

Proposed demos are:

* Getting and Cleaning data with Regex in R Part 1 ([WA WQI with Tidyverse](demos/data_import/wa_wqi/get_wa_wqi.md))
* Getting and Cleaning data with Regex in R Part 2 ([WA WQI Alternate Dataset](demos/data_import/wa_wqi/get_wa_wqi_alt.md) and [Base-R Variations](demos/data_import/wa_wqi/get_wa_wqi_2013_with_base_R.md))
* Web Scraping with rvest in R Part 1 ([NOAA Smoke Shapefiles](demos/data_import/noaa_smoke/get_noaa_smoke.md), [WA WQI Stations](demos/data_import/wa_wqi/get_wa_wqi_stations.md))
* Web Scraping with rvest in R Part 3 ([WA WQI per Station](demos/data_import/wa_wqi/get_wa_wqi_per_station.md))
* Web Scraping with rvest in R Part 3 ([EPA AQI](demos/data_import/epa_aqi/getAQI.md))
* Web Scraping with RCurl and jsonlite in R (_Historical Pollen Index_)

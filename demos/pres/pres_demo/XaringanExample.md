Xaringan and Remark.js
======================

[Remark.js](https://remarkjs.com/) is a Javascript library used for
making slide presentations like this one.

[xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) (“Presentation Nina”) is
an R package for using Remark.js with R Markdown.

You can install the `xaringan` package like this:

    remotes::install_github('yihui/xaringan')

------------------------------------------------------------------------

R Markdown
==========

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting
syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details
on using R Markdown see
<a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com" class="uri">http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com</a>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document.

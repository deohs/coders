 
Data & Statistics 
The United States has the safest, most effective vaccine supply in history. In the majority of cases, 
vaccines cause no side effects, however they can occur, as with any medication—but most are mild.  
Very rarely, people experience more serious side effects, like allergic reactions.  
In those instances, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) allows individuals to file a 
petition for compensation. 
What does it mean to be awarded compensation? 
Being awarded compensation for a petition does not necessarily mean that the vaccine caused the 
alleged injury. In fact: 
• Approximately 70 percent of all compensation awarded by the VICP comes as result of a 
negotiated settlement between the parties in which HHS has not concluded, based upon review 
of the evidence, that the alleged vaccine(s) caused the alleged injury. 
• Attorneys are eligible for reasonable attorneys’ fees, whether or not the petitioner is awarded 
compensation by the Court, if certain minimal requirements are met. In those circumstances, 
attorneys are paid by the VICP directly. By statute, attorneys may not charge any other fee, 
including a contingency fee, for his or her services in representing a petitioner in the VICP. 
What reasons might a petition result in a negotiated settlement? 
• Consideration of prior U.S. Court of Federal Claims decisions, both parties decide to minimize 
risk of loss through settlement 
• A desire to minimize the time and expense of litigating a case   
• The desire to resolve a petition quickly 
How many petitions have been awarded compensation? 
According to the CDC, from 2006 to 2018 over 3.7 billion doses of covered vaccines were distributed in 
the U.S.  For petitions filed in this time period, 7,589 petitions were adjudicated by the Court, and of 
those 5,317 were compensated. This means for every 1 million doses of vaccine that were distributed, 
approximately 1 individual was compensated. 
Since 1988, over 22,919 petitions have been filed with the VICP. Over that 30-year time period, 19,403 
petitions have been adjudicated, with 7,754 of those determined to be compensable, while 11,717 were 
dismissed. Total compensation paid over the life of the program is approximately $4.5 billion.

under the VICP.

Notes on the Adjudication Categories Table 
The date range of 01/01/2006 through 12/31/2018 was selected to reflect petitions filed since the inclusion of influenza vaccine in July 2005. Influenza vaccine now 
is named in the majority of all VICP petitions. 
In addition to the first vaccine alleged by a petitioner, which is the vaccine listed in this table, a VICP petition may allege other vaccines, which may form the basis 
of compensation. 
Vaccine doses are self-reported distribution data provided by US-licensed vaccine manufacturers. The data provide an estimate of the annual national distribution 
and do not represent vaccine administration.  In order to maintain confidentiality of an individual manufacturer or brand, the data are presented in an aggregate 
format by vaccine type. Flu doses are derived from CDC’s FluFinder tracking system, which includes data provided to CDC by US-licensed influenza vaccine 
manufacturers as well as their first line distributors. 
“Unspecified” means insufficient information was submitted to make an initial determination. The conceded “unspecified” petition was for multiple unidentified 
vaccines that caused abscess formation at the vaccination site(s), and the “unspecified” settlements were for multiple vaccines later identified in the Special 
Masters’ decisions

Definitions 
Compensable – The injured person who filed a petition was paid money by the VICP. Compensation can be achieved through a concession by the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), a decision on the merits of the petition by a special master or a judge of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims 
(Court), or a settlement between the parties. 
• Concession: HHS concludes that a petition should be compensated based on a thorough review and analysis of the evidence, including medical records 
and the scientific and medical literature. The HHS review concludes that the petitioner is entitled to compensation, including a determination either that it 
is more likely than not that the vaccine caused the injury or the evidence supports fulfillment of the criteria of the Vaccine Injury Table. The Court also 
determines that the petition should be compensated. 
• Court Decision: A special master or the court, within the United States Court of Federal Claims, issues a legal decision after weighing the evidence 
presented by both sides. HHS abides by the ultimate Court decision even if it maintains its position that the petitioner was not entitled to compensation 
(e.g., that the injury was not caused by the vaccine). 
For injury petitions, compensable court decisions are based in part on one of the following determinations by the court: 
1. The evidence is legally sufficient to show that the vaccine more likely than not caused (or significantly aggravated) the injury; or 
2. The injury is listed on, and meets all of the requirements of, the Vaccine Injury Table, and HHS has not proven that a factor unrelated to the 
vaccine more likely than not caused or significantly aggravated the injury. An injury listed on the Table and meeting all Table requirements is 
given the legal presumption of causation. It should be noted that conditions are placed on the Table for both scientific and policy reasons. 
• Settlement: The petition is resolved via a negotiated settlement between the parties. This settlement is not an admission by the United States or the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services that the vaccine caused the petitioner’s alleged injuries, and, in settled cases, the Court does not determine that 
the vaccine caused the injury. A settlement therefore cannot be characterized as a decision by HHS or by the Court that the vaccine caused an injury. 
Petitions may be resolved by settlement for many reasons, including consideration of prior court decisions; a recognition by both parties that there is a 
risk of loss in proceeding to a decision by the Court making the certainty of settlement more desirable; a desire by both parties to minimize the time and 
expense associated with litigating a case to conclusion; and a desire by both parties to resolve a case quickly and efficiently. 
• Non-compensable/Dismissed: The injured person who filed a petition was ultimately not paid money. Non-compensable Court decisions include the 
following: 
1. The Court determines that the person who filed the petition did not demonstrate that the injury was caused (or significantly aggravated) by a 
covered vaccine or meet the requirements of the Table (for injuries listed on the Table). 
2. The petition was dismissed for not meeting other statutory requirements (such as not meeting the filing deadline, not receiving a covered 
vaccine, and not meeting the statute’s severity requirement). 
3. The injured person voluntarily withdrew his or her petition.

NOTE: Some previous fiscal year data has been updated as a result of the receipt and entry of data from documents issued by the Court and system updates 
which included petitioners’ costs reimbursements in outlay totals, 
"Compensated" are petitions that have been paid as a result of a settlement between parties or a decision made by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (Court). The 
# of awards is the number of petitioner awards paid, including the attorneys' fees/costs payments, if made during a fiscal year. However, petitioners' awards and 
attorneys' fees/costs are not necessarily paid in the same fiscal year as when the petitions/petitions are determined compensable. "Dismissed" includes the # of 
payments to attorneys and the total amount of payments for attorneys' fees/costs per fiscal year. The VICP will pay attorneys' fees/costs related to the petition, 
whether or not the petition/petition is awarded compensation by the Court, if certain minimal requirements are met. "Total Outlays" are the total amount of funds 
expended for compensation and attorneys' fees/costs from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund by fiscal year. 
Since influenza vaccines (vaccines administered to large numbers of adults each year) were added to the VICP in 2005, many adult petitions related to that 
vaccine have been filed, thus changing the proportion of children to adults receiving compensation.
